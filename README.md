🏁 Racing Threads - Java Threaded Racing Simulation
This project is a simulation of a race between multiple racers using threads in Java. Each racer advances in random steps until the finish line is reached. The first runner to reach the finish line is declared the winner, and the other threads stop.

🚀 Features
Use of Threads to simulate independent runners.
Generation of random steps in each iteration.
Synchronization with synchronized to avoid concurrency problems.
Win condition that stops the execution of the other runners once there is a winner.
Technologies used
Java (JDK 8 or higher)
